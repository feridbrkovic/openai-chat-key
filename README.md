# OpenAI Chatbot with User API Key in React

This project is a chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses to user input. The chatbot is built using React and the server is built using Node.js and Express. The server connects to OpenAI's GPT-3 API and sends the user's input and API Key to the API to generate a response. The response is then sent back to the client and displayed in the chat window.
